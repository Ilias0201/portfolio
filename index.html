                <p class=text-center>My name is Ilias Skondras and I am a third-year student at The University of Cincinnati pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am originally from Canton, Ohio and graduated from GlanOak Highschool in 2018. I have been programming since my junior year of highschool and have experience with many programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, and HTML/CSS/JS. I have completed 2 Co-Op rotations with Siemens PLM Software in Milford, Ohio working on the DevOps team. In my free time I like to collect vinyl records and find new music. Thanks for viewing my page and feel free to contact me via email any time!</p>

                                    I spent my semester building a performance dashboard for NASTRAN's build results. This was my first time working on a larger scale project. This was also my first time working in a team that uses an agile workflow methodology. The dashboard was created using Python with the help of the Dash and Pandas libraries. Once I completed the project, it was put to use by multiple teams that worked on the software. Aside from the performance dashboard, I also wrote a few smaller python scripts that were used by the DevOps team to help better their workflow.

                                    During this semester I was introduced to the Jenkins automation server that our department used. I was tasked with researching whether or not our old process of running test suites would be better with Jenkins. Upon completion of my research, I wrote a python wrapper for our Jenkins processes that allowed for distribution of machine load in a cluster for our builds. From this experience I learned how to use API hooks in Python, this has already been applied to personal projects I am working on. This was also my first time working a full semester in a work from home environment, so I learned better online communication skills because I needed to speak to my team over email and IM much more often.

                                    I was team captain of my high school BEST Robotics team in 2017 and 2018. This experience taught me many new skills including 3D modeling, using a CNC machine for parts, programming with ROBOTC, the engineering design process, campaigning for funds, and advertising. It was my job as team lead to have overview of every subteam, making sure our team was staying on the right track for our end goal, and host daily meetings after school to report progress and host workshops to teach new team members. In the final competition, we were finalists among 60 different teams across the region.</p>

                                    I created a small web app with flask that uses the Spotify API that takes a user's spotify playlist data and creates a large interactive web that shows the prominence of each genre in that playlist. This was my first time using Flask and also was my first time using API hooks outside of a Co-Op experience.
